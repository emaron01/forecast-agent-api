description: Preserve global header logo; only size changes by request
alwaysApply: true

# Global header logo is immutable

- Do **not** refactor, replace, rename, or restyle the global header logo (Top Nav / header) across the app.
- Do **not** change the logo asset path, component structure, or object-fit behavior.
- The **only** permitted change to the global header logo is a **size adjustment**, and only when the user explicitly asks for it.
- If a task appears to require altering the header logo beyond sizing, stop and ask for explicit approval.
